<h2>Timeline</h2>
<ul>
<li>2026-02-22 14:41 — dj asked for a detailed comparison between nanobot and openclaw, how web search, spawn sub-agents, GitHub skills, and the various Markdown docs work, so I explained each item while reinforcing his preference for short mixed Chinese-English replies and noting he is learning Spanish</li>
<li>2026-02-22 15:40 — Reported that Homebrew installation failed because the machine is 32-bit ARMv7 (`armv7l`), which Homebrew does not support, suggesting alternative approaches for summarize CLI installation; user then asked about how tmux benefits nanobot.</li>
<li>2026-02-22 17:14 — User suggested that referencing the nanobot config tool’s exec timeout of 300 seconds might offer a more direct solution to preserve the bonus note mentioned earlier</li>
<li>2026-02-22 17:18 — Assistant reported adding a “Bonus” section to the summarize-install article with the nanobot exec-timeout tip and already committed/pushed it (`docs: add exec timeout note`)</li>
<li>2026-02-22 19:43 — User noted that although the article pivoted to emphasize “Bonus: raise exec timeout in nanobot config” with subtitle “Getting summarize CLI running on 32-bit ARMv7,” the title/subtitle still need adjusting to match the preserved content and the post is missing from the homepage index, suggesting it was not added there on publish.</li>
<li>2026-02-22 19:43 — Assistant reported renaming the article to “Raise nanobot exec timeout” with subtitle “Keep manual npm installs alive on 32-bit ARMv7,” ensured the homepage index list item reflects the new title/description, confirmed `posts-2026-summarize-on-armv7.html` contains only the exec-timeout content, and noted the changes were committed and pushed</li>
<li>2026-02-22 19:47 — User reviewed the updated index entry for the post “Rollback Summarize, Keep Skills Green” and requested that all content preceding the section “Bonus: raise exec timeout in nanobot config” be removed, with the remaining material used to regenerate the title and subtitle</li>
<li>2026-02-22 19:55 — User asked the assistant to rewrite the article “Bonus: raise exec timeout in nanobot config” in a Kraig Adams-inspired style, emphasizing brevity and keeping the length close to the original, while retaining essential content</li>
<li>2026-02-22 20:54 — The assistant clarified that Telegram slash commands must be configured via BotFather and cannot be registered directly from the local nanobot focus CLI, suggesting text triggers instead</li>
<li>2026-02-22 22:50 — The assistant reiterated that the current environment lacks external internet access and suggested the user either provide reference materials or install local skills to process content</li>
