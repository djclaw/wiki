<p>Assistant reported Substack article inaccessible beyond login wall, so user pasted the full text of Kraig Adams’ “I Stopped Thinking in Public,” detailing his shift from public ideation to private ChatGPT processing, pros/cons of visibility versus privacy, and a tiered exposure strategy culminating in monetized Field Notes / Assistant reported that the djclaw.github.io homepage was refreshed to mirror haoluo.io’s centered narrow layout with Space Grotesk, intro section, links, and tag filtering, and that the changes were committed with message “style: refresh home layout in hai luo vibe.” The user shared a poem titled “spicy & sad” (with emojis and references to spicy food and shared soup) and asked for it to be published to djclaw.</p>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<ul>
<li>2026-02-22 15:02 — Assistant reported Substack article inaccessible beyond login wall, so user pasted the full text of Kraig Adams’ “I Stopped Thinking in Public,” detailing his shift from public ideation to private ChatGPT processing, pros/cons of visibility versus privacy, and a tiered exposure strategy culminating in monetized Field Notes</li>
<li>2026-02-22 15:33 — Assistant reported that the djclaw.github.io homepage was refreshed to mirror haoluo.io’s centered narrow layout with Space Grotesk, intro section, links, and tag filtering, and that the changes were committed with message “style: refresh home layout in hai luo vibe.” The user shared a poem titled “spicy & sad” (with emojis and references to spicy food and shared soup) and asked for it to be published to djclaw.</li>
<li>2026-02-22 15:44 — Assistant reported fixing djclaw.github.io post layout by adding post.css for classic article styling while keeping haoluo-style index, and committed the changes as “style: separate post styles for haoluo index.” The user asked whether the assistant could handle the requested work or if they needed to do it themselves.</li>
<li>2026-02-22 15:45 — Assistant reported that the djclaw.github.io layout/typography issues were already fixed and only required the user to refresh their browser to see the restored article style</li>
<li>2026-02-22 16:10 — Assistant reported that all blog post subtitles were unified to the phrase “my friend told me if i am sad to eat spicy food, then i am spicy and sad” and pushed as commit style: unify post subtitles</li>
<li>2026-02-22 16:12 — Assistant reported styling edits and push for the “spicy and sad” post per haoluo-style requirements, keeping the subtitle unchanged</li>
<li>2026-02-22 16:30 — Assistant reported the summarize CLI installation still times out at 60 seconds and offered to retry with a different npm mirror or longer timeout</li>
<li>2026-02-22 16:34 — Assistant reported switching npm registry to npmmirror, yet installing @steipete/summarize still times out after 60 seconds and suggested downloading the tarball for faster local installation</li>
<li>2026-02-22 17:00 — Assistant reported being unable to draft the new blog post because the environment lacks the apply_patch utility and asked the user whether to enable it or use another method like write_file</li>
<li>2026-02-22 17:01 — Assistant reported creating and pushing the post posts-2026-summarize-on-armv7.html summarizing the summarize CLI installation journey on the user’s 32-bit ARMv7 host, including failed npm installs, registry switches, manual deployment steps, PATH configuration, and a sample summarize command; the user then asked whether apply_patch was used for those modifications.</li>
