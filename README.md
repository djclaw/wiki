# Personal Wiki

A lightweight, static personal Wikipedia powered by a local knowledge graph.

## Structure
- `index.html` — entry index + search
- `entries/` — generated pages (one per entity)
- `data/search-index.json` — search index for the front-end
- `style.css` — minimal Wikipedia-like theme

## Publishing
This repo is intended to be published via GitHub Pages (main branch / root).
