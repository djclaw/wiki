      "2026-02-24 14:03 — After the wiki repo update was pushed, the assistant asked to proceed with building a Wikipedia-style entity page template and a search index generation script for the personal knowledge graph site",
      "2026-02-24 14:04 — After the wiki repo update was pushed and Pages set to auto-update, the assistant proposed two steps for the personal knowledge graph site: (1) Wikipedia-style entity page template/layout and (2) a simple local search index generator script",
      "2026-02-24 14:05 — User agreed to proceed with step 1 for the personal knowledge graph site: creating a Wikipedia-style entity template, a shared layout template, and adding infobox/TOC styles in CSS.",
      "2026-02-24 14:06 — User confirmed to proceed after step 1 completion for the personal knowledge graph site, approving moving on to step 2: building the search index generation script (SQLite/JSON → search-index.json).",

      "2026-02-24 14:17 — User responded after the wiki repo push and requested a security/privacy change: going forward, any SQLite data should not be written to GitHub and no sensitive information should be leaked to GitHub",
      "2026-02-24 14:21 — Assistant proposed starting step 1 for the personal knowledge graph site: create a sample entity page at entries/nyc.html after locating the wiki repo path and updating the index, and asked for confirmation",
      "2026-02-24 14:22 — Continued personal knowledge graph site work: assistant noted infobox/TOC styles refined and asked how to source tags/categories (from entity page markup vs separate data/entries.json)"
